    </div></h4>
<h6>Background</h6>
<p>User Interviews of the following staff members were conducted in accordance with their respective roles as shown in the figure below. Organizational fit of the interviewees was analyzed before to understand the workflow between the different members. A comprehensive interview protocol was developed based on our background research and problem definition.</p>
<img src="Images/org.jpg" alt="organization" class="image2">
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>Based on background research and analysis, an interview protocol was developed which touched upon the following 3 categories addressing the given overarching questions:</p>

<div class="smallgrey">
<ul class="greylistsmall">
  <li><strong>Management and Coordination:</strong> What is the "people-side" workflow in coordinating grants and donations?</li>
  <li><strong>Grant Management:</strong> How does the Corner Health Center  use Donor Perfect to track and manage grant details?</li>
  <li><strong>Communication and Outreach:</strong> How connected does the organization feel with their donors?</li>
</ul>
</div>
<br>
<br>

<p>Each interview session was recorded, interpreted and annotated to identify key insights, strengths, and areas for improvement.</p>

<h4>Affinity Wall
  <div id="line">
  </div></h4>
  <br>
  <br>
<p>After consolidating notes from each interview, we gathered 350 data points were organized into information clusters called affinity notes. Each cluster was further organized into a  meta cluster which was again organized under a higher level cluster and so on. The highest level of information provided us with key pain-points and problems existing in our client organization. The images below gives an overview of what our version of affinity wall looked like.</p>

  <h4>Recommendations

    <br>
    <br>
<p>The findings of the Contextual Inquiry process presented mismanaged collaboration and information gaps as a key underlying problem. The inconsistent internal communication and collaboration was the target issue which aimed to resolve. To overcome this problem, we essentially identified ways that could improve their internal collaboration, and recommended the use of an <strong> Internal Collaboration and Communication software.</strong>

<h6>Recommendation 1: Collaboration Software</h6>

<p>In deciding upon the appropriate collaborative tool, it was important to consider certain criteria relevant to the organization, and considering its nonprofit status. The criteria considered were not only to ensure successful communication and collaboration, but also features that a non-profit organization can benefit from which other tools might not offer.
